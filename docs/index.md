# Welcome to the AKASHA documentation

Explore how to build amazing integrations using AKASHA Core (applications, widgets and plugins) and create unique experiences in the Akasha World.

### What is AKASHA Core?

Today, AKASHA Core is a framework that aims to facilitate the development of integrations in our microblogging site called [Akasha World](https://akasha.ethereum.world/). By providing it, we expect developers to have the opportunity to build and innovate in this decentralized social network ecosystem.

In the future, we envision AKASHA Core as the platform that will allow people to create and sustain social technological spaces we call [Worlds](https://akasha.org/blog/2019/11/21/what-is-akasha-reloaded-what-is-ethereum-world).

## AKASHA integrations

### Applications

Applications are standalone components that complement and extend Ethereans social network experience.

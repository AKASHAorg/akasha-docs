# Welcome to the AKASHA documentation

Explore how to build amazing integrations (applications, widgets and plugins) using AKASHA Core and create unique experiences in the Akasha World.

## What is AKASHA Core?

Today, AKASHA Core is the open-sourced framework for building and distributing composable web3 apps, serving as the foundation for our microblogging site, [Akasha World](https://akasha.ethereum.world/). By providing this framework, we expect developers to have the opportunity to build and innovate in this decentralized social network ecosystem.

With AKASHA Core, we make it easier for people to create and sustain social technological spaces we call [Worlds](https://blog.akasha.org/what-is-akasha-reloaded-what-is-ethereum-world/).

## AKASHA integrations

### Applications

Applications are standalone components that complement and extend your web3 social network experience.

[Learn more](./extensions/applications.md)

### Widgets

Widgets allow Ethereans to perform quick actions or access small pieces of information relating to an app (app-specific widgets) or the world (general widgets).

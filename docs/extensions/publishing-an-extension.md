# Publishing an Extension

All the extension must be first published to the extensions registry to be discoverable in the Extensions App.
The following section will guide you through the extension publishing process.

## Enable dev-mode

Enabling dev-mode will allow you to create draft extensions in the Extensions App.
Draft extensions are not yet published and only available in the browser used to create them (are saved client-side).

This section is a work in progress.

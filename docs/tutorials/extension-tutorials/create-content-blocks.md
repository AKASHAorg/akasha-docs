# Create content blocks
:::info
To create a content-block you must first [create an app](./create-an-app.md). This is because content-blocks are not standalone extensions, they are always provided by apps.
:::

In this tutorial we will create a simple [content-block](../extensions/content_blocks.md) that will allow users to add code-blocks to the beams.

To keep it simple, we will use a `<textarea>` element to input the code and a `<code>` element to render. Afterwards we can add live-preview using [Prismjs](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/) for syntax highlighting.

# Data Fetching and Mutations

Fetching the data from the Ceramic node can be done using the generated apollo hooks available through 
the [@akashaorg/ui-core-hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@akashaorg/ui-core-hooks) package or directly using 
the APIs available through the [@akashaorg/core-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@akashaorg/core-sdk) package. Click on any of the cards below to go straight into the available sections.

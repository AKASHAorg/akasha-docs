## What is AKASHA Core?

**AKASHA Core** is an open-source framework for building and distributing composable web3 apps.

It enables communities to create their own online spaces, called [**Worlds**](https://akasha.org/world/). Designed as a modular system, it provides developers with the tools to create and extend decentralized social experiences.

AKASHA Core is the foundation of the decentralized social platform [**AKASHA World**](https://next.akasha-world-framework.pages.dev/).

## Extensions on AKASHA Core

Social experiences built with AKASHA Core can be enhanced through **Extensions**, which include **Applications, Widgets, and Plugins**.

### Applications

**Applications** are standalone components that complement and extend your web3 social network experience. They serve specific functions within a World by providing distinct features to enhance the overall user experience. [Learn more](./extensions/applications.md).

### Widgets

**Widgets** are compact UI elements that offer quick access to useful information or actions. They can be `app-specific widgets`, tied to a particular application, or `general widgets`, providing broader functionality within a World. [Learn more](./extensions/widgets.md).

### Plugins

**Plugins** provide APIs and system-level services for applications and widgets. They extend capabilities without rendering anything in the user interface. [Learn more](./extensions/plugins.md).

All extensions built with AKASHA Core are open-source. [Explore](https://next.akasha-world-framework.pages.dev/@akashaorg/app-extensions/installed-extensions) the available extensions in AKASHA World to get inspired or learn from existing implementations.

## Build once, empower many

When you deploy a new extension, it's not limited to just one World, it can be used by other Worlds as well. By building for yourself, you're also contributing to a shared ecosystem where others can benefit from your work. Likewise, you can leverage extensions created by others, accelerating development and fostering collaboration across multiple Worlds.

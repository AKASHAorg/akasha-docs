## What is AKASHA Core?

Today, AKASHA Core is the open-sourced framework for building and distributing composable web3 apps, serving as the foundation for our microblogging site, [Akasha World](https://next.akasha-world-framework.pages.dev/).

AKASHA Core makes it easier for people to create and sustain social technological spaces we call [Worlds](https://blog.akasha.org/what-is-akasha-reloaded-what-is-ethereum-world/) and empowers developers with tools to build and innovate in the decentralized social network ecosystem.

## Extensions on AKASHA Core

Social experiences built with AKASHA Core can often be extended through various ways like applications, widgets and plugins. These are collectively referred to as "Integratons" or "Extensions"

### Applications

Applications are standalone components that complement and extend your web3 social network experience. [Learn more](./extensions/applications.md)

### Widgets

Widgets allow users to perform quick actions or access short but useful information relating to an application (`app-specific widgets`) or the world (`general widgets`). [Learn more](./extensions/widgets.md)

All extensions built with AKASHA Core are open-source. Find in the table below, the list of current extensions available in AKASHA World. Explore them whenever you want to get inspired or learn.

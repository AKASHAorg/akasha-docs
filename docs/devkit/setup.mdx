After you have [installed the Devkit locally](./#installation), you will need to load it into a world.

The Devkit can be loaded into any world but for development purposes we'll load it into AKASHA's staging enviromnent
available at [https://next.akasha-world-framework.pages.dev/](https://next.akasha-world-framework.pages.dev/).

<div class="tip-card">
  <p>
    Make sure that you can load the `mainFile` (its url should be shown in your
    terminal) - as it will require bypassing the browser's SSL warning.

## Starting from scratch

:::tip
Skip the following steps only if you have already completed them.
:::

1. Authenticate on https://next.akasha-world-framework.pages.dev/ - optionally, create a profile, if you do not have one yet.
   <hr />
2. Navigate to the [**Extensions App -> Explore**](https://next.akasha-world-framework.pages.dev/@akashaorg/app-extensions/explore) page from the sidebar.

   <hr />

4. On the next page, enable `Extensions Developer Mode`, and wait for the page to reload.

   <hr />

5. Having enabled `Extensions Developer Mode`, you will have access to a new page in the [**Extensions App -> My Extensions**](https://next.akasha-world-framework.pages.dev/@akashaorg/app-extensions/my-extensions)

   <hr />

6. Navigate to the [**Extensions App -> My Extensions**](https://next.akasha-world-framework.pages.dev/@akashaorg/app-extensions/my-extensions), click on `Create` extension and fill out the form (example values show below)

- Extension Type: <span style={{color: 'tomato'}}>App</span> // for now, we only support App extensions
- Extension ID: <span style={{color: 'tomato'}}>extension-devkit</span> // you can find this id in the terminal where you ran the Devkit
- Extension Display Name: <span style={{color: 'tomato'}}>My Extension</span> // choose how this extension will be displayed in its extension profile page
- Extension License: <span style={{color: 'tomato'}}>MIT</span> // or choose what licence this extension should have
  <hr />

7. Click on `Create Locally` button and on the next page click on `Manage Releases` button.

<div class="tip-card">
  This is your `Release Manager` page from which you can create new releases for
  this extension. But for now we are only interested in loading this extension's
  source for testing purposes.
</div>
<hr />

8. Click on the `Test Release` button as shown in the following screenshot:

<img src="/img/release-manager.gif" style={{ maxWidth: "60%" }} />
<hr />

9. On the next screen, fill out the `Source URL` field with the url of your `mainFile` -> its url should be shown in your terminal. The other fields are optional.

<div class="tip-card">
  The next step is very important when loading the extension in the staging
  environment (https://next.akasha-world-framework.pages.dev). It can be skipped
  if you are running the world locally (generally on https://localhost:8131).
</div>
<hr />

10. Open the `Developer Tools` (for Chrome: right click on the page and click on `inspect`).

- Go to the `Application` tab and then select the `service worker` from the side-panel
- Enable `Bypass for network` checkbox like shown below

11. Click on the `Test Release` button and the extension should now start to load.

<div class="tip-card">
  <h3>ðŸ™Œ Congrats!</h3>
  <p>
    You can now start to develop extensions using your local installation of the
    Devkit. Start playing with it!
  </p>
  <p>
    Notice that it has live-reload feature when you make changes to the source
    code.

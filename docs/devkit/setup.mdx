After you've installed the devkit locally, you'll need to load it into a world.

The devkit can be loaded into any world but for development purposes we'll load it into AKASHA's staging enviromnent
available at [https://next.akasha-world-framework.pages.dev/](https://next.akasha-world-framework.pages.dev/).

<div style={{ borderImage: 'linear-gradient(to right, #27e1ba 0%, #8739e0 100%) 1', borderRadius: '.5rem', borderStyle: 'solid', padding: '1rem'}}>
 **Please make sure that you can load the `mainFile` - it's url should be shown in your terminal - as it will require bypassing browser's SSL warning.**
</div>

**Starting from scratch** (skip the steps only if you already completed them)

1. authenticate on https://next.akasha-world-framework.pages.dev/
    - optionally create a profile :D
<hr/>

2. navigate to the Extensions app -> Explore page

<hr/>

3. scroll down to the last card and `Start your journey` as a developer:
<img src="/img/start_journey.png" style={{maxWidth: '66%'}} />
<hr/>

4. on the next page, enable `Extensions Developer Mode`, and wait for the page to reload.
<hr/>

5. now that you have enabled developer mode, you will have access to a new page in the Extensions App -> My Extensions
<hr/>

6. go to Extensions -> My Extensions, click on `Create` extension and fill out the form:
```
Extension Type: App
Extension ID: extension-devkit // you can find this id in the terminal where you ran the devkit
Extension Display Name: My Extension // choose how this extension will be displayed in it's profile page
Extension License: MIT // or choose what licence this extension should have
```
<hr/>

7. click on `Create Locally` and on the next page click on `Manage Releases`

<div style={{ borderImage: 'linear-gradient(to right, #27e1ba 0%, #8739e0 100%) 1', borderRadius: '.5rem', borderStyle: 'solid', padding: '1rem'}}>
**This is your `Release Manager` page from which you can create new releases for this extension.**
</div>

But for now we are only interested in loading this extension's source for testing purposes.
<hr/>

8. click on the `Test Release` button as shown in the following screenshot:
<img src="/img/release-manager.png" />
<hr/>

9. on the next screen fill out the `Source URL` field with the url of your `mainFile` -> it's url should be shown in your terminal. The other fields are optional.
<hr/>

<div style={{ borderImage: 'linear-gradient(to right, #27e1ba 0%, #8739e0 100%) 1', borderRadius: '.5rem', borderStyle: 'solid', padding: '1rem'}}>
The next step is very important when loading the extension in the staging environment (https://next.akasha-world-framework.pages.dev). It can be skipped if you are running the world locally (generally on https://localhost:8131).
</div>
<hr />

10. open the developer tools (for Chrome: right click on the page and click on inspect).
    - go to the Application tab and then select the service worker from the side-panel
    - enable `Bypass for network` checkbox like shown below

<img src="/img/service-worker-bypass.png" />

<hr/>

11. click on the `Test Release` button and the extension should now start to load.

<div style={{ borderImage: 'linear-gradient(to right, #27e1ba 0%, #8739e0 100%) 1', borderRadius: '.5rem', borderStyle: 'solid', padding: '1rem'}}>
    **Congrats!** You can not start to develop using your local installation of the devkit.
    <div>Start playing with it!  Notice that it has live-reload when you make changes to the source code.</div>

After you have [installed the Devkit locally](./index.mdx#installation), you will need to load it into a world.

The Devkit can be loaded into any world but for development purposes we'll load it into AKASHA's staging enviromnent
available at [https://next.akasha-world-framework.pages.dev/](https://next.akasha-world-framework.pages.dev/).

:::caution
We recommend using an up-to-date version of `Chrome` browser for the best experience.
:::

Let's get started to load the Devkit into the staging environment:

1. On your browser, load the `mainFile` (its url should be shown in your terminal), allow the browser to load the page by clicking on `Advanced` and then `Proceed to ... (unsafe)`. This step is required to bypass the browser's SSL warning

---

2. On this same browser window, open a different tab and visit https://next.akasha-world-framework.pages.dev/ and authenticate (create a new profile or connect an existing account)

---

3. After authenticating, navigate to the [**Extensions App -> Explore**](https://next.akasha-world-framework.pages.dev/@akashaorg/app-extensions/explore) page from the sidebar

---

4. Scroll down to the last card (image shown below) and click on `Start your journey` as a developer

---

5. On the next page, enable `Extensions Developer Mode`, and wait for the page to reload. This allows you to access the My Extensions page from the sidebar

---

6. Navigate to the [**Extensions App -> My Extensions**](https://next.akasha-world-framework.pages.dev/@akashaorg/app-extensions/my-extensions) from the sidebar, click on `Create` extension and fill out the form (example values show below)

```tsx
- Extension Type: "App" // for now, we only support App extensions
- Extension ID: "extension-devkit" // you can find this id in the terminal where you ran the Devkit
- Extension Display Name: "My Extension" // choose how this extension will be displayed in its extension profile page
- Extension License: "MIT" // or choose what licence this extension should have
```

---

7. Click on `Create locally` button and on the next page, click on `Manage Releases` button

<div className=" card tip-card">
  This is your `Release Manager` page from which you can create new releases for
  this extension. But for now we are only interested in loading this extension's
  source file for testing purposes
</div>

---

8. Click on the `Test Release` button as shown in the following screenshot:

<img src="/img/release-manager.gif" style={{ maxWidth: "60%" }} />

---

9. On the next screen, fill out the `Source URL` field with the url of your `mainFile` (refer to step 1). The other fields are optional

<div className="card tip-card">
  The next step is very important when loading the extension in the staging
  environment (https://next.akasha-world-framework.pages.dev). It can be skipped
  if you are running the world locally (generally on https://localhost:8131).
</div>

---

10. Open the `Developer Tools` (For Chrome: Right click on the page and click on `inspect`)

- Go to the `Application` tab, then select the `service worker` from the side-panel
- Enable `Bypass for network` checkbox like shown below
- **Keep the developer tools open** as you proceed to the next step

11. Back on the web page, click on the `Test Release` button. The extension should then load in the staging environment and display the welcome page

    You can now start to develop extensions using your local installation of the
    Devkit. Start playing with it!

    Notice that it has live-reload feature when you make changes to the source
    code.

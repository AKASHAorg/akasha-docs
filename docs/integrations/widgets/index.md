# Widgets Overview

Widgets are small pieces of functionality that are meant to be reusable across multiple pages. A widget cannot have it's own routes, hence you cannot navigate to a widget and they have a predefined areas in the page's layout.

The areas are generally defined by the [Layout Widget](/docs/integrations/layout-widget).

# Applications Overview

Applications are the main building blocks of a world and it can be seen as a standalone SPA (Single Page Application) except that they are loaded, mounted and unmounted by the underlying system (App Loader) which is a thin layer on top of the [single-spa](https://single-spa.js.org/) library.

Some of the examples of apps that are available in Ethereum World are:
 - Social App
